    <h1>
        C++++ - A Specification
    </h1>
    <p>
        This is the official (but not formal) specification for the C++++ programming language! Although it's intended
        to be used by people wishing to implement a C++++
        compiler, it can also be used by developers wishing to write C++++ programs. As a result, this document will not
        assume which position that you, the reader, takes.
        Instead, I'll refer to C++++ developers and compiler vendors as separate entities in this document.
    </p>
    <p>
        A pattern that you might encounter within this specification is the lack of formal language. We still don't know
        how to write formal documents yet so you'll just have to deal with it. But we will try to make this document as
        unambiguous
        as possible to avoid language confusion and compiler-specific functionalities.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Background
    </h2>
    <p>
        Basically, C++++ is this system programming language that I created since I was bored. It started in late 2022
        and, as of right now, currently does not possess
        a reference implementation. The language is currently merely a specification that anyone can implement if they
        wanted to.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, C++++ is a compiled language and should not be used as an interpreted language, though nothing is gonna
        prevent
        you from implementing a C++++ interpreter so if you wanted to, go ahead. However, as you will see layer,
        implementing
        C++++ as an interpreted language might be more difficult than a language designed for use as an interpreter,
        like
        Python.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another thing to note about C++++ is that, despite the name, it is not backwards compatible with neither C nor
        C++.
        We have chosen to remove backwards-compatibility with C/C++ because if we're just gonna create a superset of
        C++,
        we might as well just propose a change to the C++ Standards Commitee.

    <h2>
        Language Conventions
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Naming Conventions
    </h3>
    <p>
        There are certain naming conventions used within the C++++ standard library and the rest of the language. These
        naming conventions are generally followed with a few
        exceptions (like, for example, the integer naming conventions).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Everything is named with <i>snake casing</i> (i.e. <code>get_internal_states</code>).
        </li>
        <li>
            All the letters in the name of a constant are uppercase (i.e. <code>MAXIMUM_PORT_NUMBER</code>).
        </li>
        <li>
            All types are postfixed with <code>_t</code> (i.e. <code>dynamic_array_t</code>)
        </li>
        <li>
            The usage of abbreviations are kept to a minimum.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Please note that although the language and the standard library almost always abide to these naming conventions,
        developers are not required or encouraged to use them. However, to maintain consistency within the language,
        compiler vendors implementing extensions are recommended to follow these conventions whenever possible.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Extensions
    </h2>
    <p>
        Extensions are a way for the implementors of C++++ compilers to insert their own features into the language
        and developers to use those extensions easily. Other multi-implementation languages, like C++, does have
        extensions as well, but since the language doesn't have a <i>concept</i> of an extension, the difficulty of
        checking for the existence of an extension often outweighs the benifits the extensions provide. C++++, however,
        have standard support for extensions, allowing developers to easily take advantage of them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although compiler vendors can name their extensions however they'd like, it is strongly recommended that
        extension
        names uses snake casing (for consistency with the standard extensions and the rest of the language) and are
        prefixed
        with the compiler vendors's names (to avoid name collisions).
    </p>
    <p>
        There are also <i>standard extensions</i>, basically extensions that are part of the standard C++++
        specification
        but are not neccessarily required in an implementation of C++++. Any compiler vendor can implement any standard
        extensions,
        and they choose not to do so as well. Standard extensions allows us, the language designers, to add features
        that may
        not be applicable in every usage setting of the C++++ programming language.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Using extensions
    </h3>
    <p>
        To use any extensions, standard or not, the extension in question must first be manually enabled by the
        developer. This
        is to prevent developers from accidentally using a feature that is part of an extension thinking that it is part
        of the
        core language.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first method for enabling extensions is by using the <code>extension</code> statement in the C++++ source
        file. This will
        enable the extension for the entire file, but only within the file in which the statement resides within. The
        syntax of this
        method is shown below.
    </p>
    <code>
extension <i>extension_name</i>;
    </code>
    <p>
        Compiler vendors can also choose to add compiler flags for enabling extensions.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Fundamental Language Features
    </h2>
    <p>
        This section will describe some of the most common language features in the world of programming, like
        variables, functions, etc.
        It is going to be mainly a description of how C++++ implements a lot of these features rather than an
        explanation of the concepts
        themselves.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Data Types
    </h3>
    <p>
        Because C++++ is a statically typed language, there are often cases in which the developer needs to specify data
        types. C++++ has a number of data types built in to the
        language itself.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Integer Types
    </h4>
    <p>
        Integers are numeric values that does not contain fractional components. C++++ offers both signed and unsigned integers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below is a list of all the integer types offered by C++++.
    </p>

            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

    <h3>
        Functions
    </h3>
    <p>
        Functions, sometimes known as <i>procedures</i> in some languages, are collections of code that can be executed.
        The syntax for a
        function is shown below.
    </p>
    <code>
function name(parameter_name: type, ...) -> return_type_t
{
    // Function body
    // ...
}
    </code>
    <!-- TODO: Add a more detailed description of functions -->
    <p>
        To summarize:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>function</code> is a built-in keyword of the C++++. It is used to declare a function.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>name</code> is the name of the function. This name may not reflect the actual name of the function in
            the compiled binary, as compilers are free to mangle function names for various purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>parameter_name</code> is the name of one of the parameters of the function, which are data passed to
            the function when it's <i>called</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <code>type</code> is the <i>data type</i> of <code>parameter_name</code>. C++++ is a statically typed
            language, and as a result the types of all the function parameters must be known at compile time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>return_type_t</code> is the data type of the return value of the function. Omit the return type to
            indicate that the function does not return a value.
        </li>
    </ul>
